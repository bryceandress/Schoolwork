As of submission the searchEmployees function corrupts the stack. When working ideally the function should prompt user for a name to search. If the name exists print that
employees record. If the name is not found in the stack the program should print out "did not found and prompt again". If Ctrl-D is pressed the program should exit gracefully since 
searchEmployees is the last function.
