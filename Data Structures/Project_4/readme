BUGS:
The Letter search feature appears to be working after many changes. Code is documented to what I believe is happening, there my be edge cases.

The functors were not able to be added in the State.h last time I tested it. I have unfortuantely ran out of time to further test. They are 
currently located in the p4.cpp file and appear to be working fine. If you get the chance to look into this I would really like to know why it would
not compile. (It very well may compile right away, a lot of things have changed since I have last tried them in the State.h file).
